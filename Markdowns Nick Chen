#### Answers:

##### Hypothesis:
Polarized LEDs could be a possible alternative to cost effective general light source of the future and bring in massive savings.
The experiment aims to achieve high levels of light emission through enhancing the brightness and polarization 
of the light emitting diodes. m-plane GaN LEDs were first developed and more intensively investigated due to the 
possible reduction of polarization-induced electric fields in the QWs. The wide avaliablity of these LEDs allow the
investigation and testing of enhanced polarization for light detection and reduction of glare. 


##### Experimets:
Embedded PhC fabrication 
LED fabrication
Optical characterization 
embedding air gaps within the GaN, which results in a large contrast in refractive index
DIRECTIONAL ENHANCEMENT OF POLARIZED LIGHT EMISSION
Excitation of guided modes in photonic crystals


##### Conclusion
he polarization-preserving and directional light extraction properties from PhCs, 
along with the enhanced interaction of the embedded PhCs with the guided light, were 
combined to yield a directional polarized light emitting diode. A directional enhancement
of polarized light emission was increased by 1.8 fold. A high degree of polarization of 
88.7% was acheived at 465nm, this gurantees higher brightness and makes it applicable in 
real world appliances such as smart phone screens, LCD tvs etc but also for general lighting use.

#### Answers:

##### Hypothesis:
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by
overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.
They target a wide variety of significant resources, from banks to websites hosting massive personal information
that can cause delays and great security risks for users. 
To combat DDOS the aim is to enhance the anlayzation of network/packets in complex systems by using JPCAP packet capturing 
library with WinCap for Detection and analysis of network traffic on a prime target of DDoS Attack


##### Experimets:
Windows Packet Capture provides the facility to access low-level network in Windows operating environment. It can
transmit network traffic along with protocol stack and process. It allows kernel-level packet filtering. 
1. Obtain and open the network. 
2. Set the traffic type wireless or Ethernet. 
3. Set threshold or it will calculate by default. 
4. Check incoming traffic 
5. Calculate DDoS Probability and Show report
6. Generate analyzer report based on the detection alerts and notification to the user.


##### Conclusion
The experiment captured live traffic from the network with the internet shared. The Algorithm used in this experiment 
scans the various vulnerabilities within the network parameter in the likelihood of a DDOS attack. 
TCP, ICMP and UDP packets that are more susceptible to get flood or pinged for DDoS attacks. 
TO combad the attacks, the algorithm checks the source and destination address that verifies wether the 
user is authenticated to access the network or not, allowing other protocals to be initiated for the purpose of neturalizing the
threat once it's detected and held at the access point. 

## Digital Voltmeter

### Development of a High Precision Digital Volt Meter

#### Answers:

##### Hypothesis:
The experiment aims to design a voltmeter that can measure up to 0 to 30.00V with 0.01V precision.
The circuit mainly consists of a voltage divider circuit, and a 16*1 LCD display which are interfaced to
the 8 bit microcontroller ATmega328P. r. The ATmega328 consists of an inbuilt ADC which converts the voltage 
to a digital value. The microcontroller is programmed to convert this digital value again to the value of
applied voltage. The value is then displayed through a LCD display. 
When the supply is given, the controller initially checks whether the applied voltage falls within the required range. If yes,
the applied voltage is displayed on the LCD. Else the controller waits till a voltage that falls within the rated range is
applied. 


##### Experimets:
1.Interface micro controller with Hardware components
2.Unknown voltage given to A0 port of microprocessor
3.Check if supplied voltage is within range
4.Multiply voltage value with multiplication factor/FEED to LCD display


##### Conclusion
The assembled high accuracy voltmeter is a success with standout features being easy to use and low power consumption.
Largely due to the microcontroller selected for the experiment. This result achieved in the experiment amplifies the 
existing advantages with the digital voltmeter compared to analogue ones, Digital Voltmeter gives readings as numerical display. 
They also provide outputs that can be transmitted over distance, can
activate printers and typewriters, and can feed to computers. These integrate outputs for monitoring, controlling,
transmitting, and printing of data. Advanced systems are often connected to computers, allowing for automation,
optimization of processes, and prevention of malfunctions and critical failure safeties.
