## What is _Ethics_ in _Science_?

### A short story of History

A british archaeologist and paleontologist named 'Charles Dawson' made some
famous discoveries of new found species and named them after himself:

- Plagiaulax dawsoni
- Iguanodon dawsoni
- Salaginella dawsoni

And in 1912 he showed his newest discovery, a fossilied humanoid that was the
missing link between humans and apes found in the gravel beds near Piltdown
(England).
The so called **Piltdown Man** (Eoanthropus dawsoni).

Up to 1953 the claims of Mr. Dawson was taken as correct and the truth.
Specifically Mr. Arthur Smith Woodward of the _Natural History Museum London_
defended the validity of the found.

In 1953 the student Joseph Weiner had doubts about the fossils, because some of
it look not correct.
In investigation with his Professor Wilfred Edward Le Gros Clark and Kenneth
Oakley, they found that the skull was from a medieval human, the jawbone from an
orangutan and the teeth from chimpanzee.
The teeth were even hand filed to make them fit the skull.

### What means this for science?

Many professions in science have a formalized system of ethical practices.
Nowadays it so rooted in their practice that most fellows of a profession do not
have to think about it during their work.
_Because_, that is how they work.

Ethics in science asks for integrity and honesty.
Therefore scientists should:

1. Correct and complete recording of the research done.
2. Be honest when reporting data used in their research.
3. Embrace independend analysis and interpretation of results and data.
4. Seek for independend verification through peer-review.
5. Be aware to weighing in the rights of human and animal.
6. Properly give credit and naming of sources of information, data, ideas used.
