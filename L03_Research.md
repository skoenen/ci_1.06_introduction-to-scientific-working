# Introduction to 'Scientific Working'

## How to research?

_Research_ can be divided into six steps.
Following these steps, should results in good science.

### Process of research

1. Observe phenomenon
2. Search already existing work
3. Formulate Explanation (Hypothesis)
4. Gather Information (Experiment)
5. Analyze Information
6. Verify or Falsify Hypothesis
7. Report/Publish

### Search

In these days it is most likely that there is already some work done regarding
our observed phenomenon.
To avoid already done mistakes or repeat work scientists use published research
to learn.

A additional difficulty here is, that most of the published work is only
accessible through payed subscriptions.
In the last years a new form of publication occurs _Open Access_.
After that the either found an explanation or have more questions to answer.

There are some tools on the Internet to help in the process of research:

- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com)
- [Springer (access from inside hsrw network)](https://link.springer.com)
- [Open Access](https://open-access.net)

### Methods for Experiments

Different methods that can be utilized to do gather information:

- Experiments
- Surveys
  - Questionnairies
  - Interviews
- Case studies
- Observations
  - Participant
  - Non-participant
  - Trails

### Methods and application

Not all methods are always suitable for each application.
Some methods are more intended for human oriented research, where others work
good with physical research.

### Objective research

Subjects of research in this field are 

- Externally Observable
- Data not directly influenced by the way the research method is conducted.

### Subjective research

- Not externally observable
- Can be influenced by the way the research method is conducted.

### Analyze Research

Data gathered in experiments is at first data. There is no obvious conclusion.
Data has to be analyzed to make use of it and derive a conclusion.

This conclusion can either be the 
- evidence that the hypothesis formulated is the explanation for the observed
  phenomenon
- or it is evidence that the hypothesis is not the explanation
- or it is indicating something completly different outcome

### Verify/Falsify Hypothesis

With the gathered data and the analysis the hypothesis can be confirmed to be
correct or refuted.

In both cases it is important to explain the way of interpretation of the data.

### Report/Publish

The outcomes of the research should be published independent of their outcome.
In this way research can base on already existing science.

And science is knowledge, and knowledge is only if it is **known**.

_We will discuss publication in more detail later._
